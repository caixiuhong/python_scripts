$ python readms/src/read_ms_processor.py new_version readms/example/ms.dat
```
Or read old version generated by /home/cai/mcce3.5
```bash
$ python readms/src/read_ms_processor.py old_version readms/example/old_ms.dat
```
Or read Stable-MCCE version generated by /home/cai/Github/Stable-MCCE
```bash
$ python readms/src/read_ms_processor.py Stable-MCCE readms/example/pH7eH0ms.txt
```
because old_ms.dat is too large, it is not included in readms/example, please add by yourself.
