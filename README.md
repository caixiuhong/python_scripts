## 1. Readme
The python module to read microstate in MCCE, old version and new version.

Read new version ms.dat generated by /home/cai/mcce3.5_enum_ms
```bash
$ python readms/src/read_ms_processor.py new_version ../example/ms.dat
```
Or read old version generated by /home/cai/mcce3.5
```bash
$ python readms/src/read_ms_processor.py old_version ../example/old_ms.dat
```
because old_ms.dat is too large, it is not included in readms/example, please add by yourself.

Readme module can be import as a python module

Please see example/tutorial.ipynb for instruction
